# Short Story Pipeline

This repository provides a modular pipeline for short story creation that prioritizes **distinctive voice, memorable characters, and non-generic language**. Every word must earn its place.

> **See [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md) for core principles and terminology.**

- Premise capture (unique idea, distinctive character, resonant theme)
- Outline (beginning, middle, end with unexpected beats)
- Scaffolding (POV, tone, style that creates voice)
- Drafting (prose narrative with precision and pop)
- Revision (language sharpening, character deepening, cliché elimination)

## Features
- Enforces word count (≤ 7500 words) while maximizing impact
- Anti-generic filters (see [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md))
- Voice development tools (see [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md))
- Character distinctiveness validation (see [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md))
- Conflict-first scaffolding for clarity
- Modular design for extensibility

## Getting Started

## Roadmap
- Add automated word-count validator
