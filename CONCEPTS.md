# Core Concepts — Short Story Pipeline

This document defines the foundational principles and terminology used throughout the pipeline. Reference this document rather than redefining concepts elsewhere.

## Core Philosophy

**"Every word must earn its place"** — Stories should pop with distinctive voice, memorable characters, and non-generic language, not blend into generic narratives.

## Key Principles

### Distinctiveness
Stories must avoid:
- Generic language and clichéd phrases
- Stock characters and archetypal personalities
- Predictable story beats and formulaic plots

### Voice Development
- **Narrative Voice**: Distinctive perspective, rhythm, and linguistic texture
- **Character Voices**: Unique speech patterns, vocabulary, and rhythm for each character
- **Voice Consistency**: Maintains distinctiveness throughout all pipeline stages

### Memorability
Language and character choices prioritize impact over formula:
- Specific, vivid language over generic descriptions
- Unique quirks and contradictions over archetypal traits
- Unexpected beats over predictable story structures

## Core Tools & Systems

### Character Voice Analyzer
Ensures distinct speech patterns, vocabulary, and rhythm for each character. Tracks:
- Dialect and regional markers
- Vocabulary quirks and preferences
- Speech rhythm and sentence structure
- Consistency across dialogue

### Cliché Detection System
Flags and suggests replacements for:
- Generic phrases and stock descriptions
- Predictable story beats
- Archetypal character traits
- Formulaic plot structures

### Memorability Scorer
Assesses distinctiveness metrics:
- Voice strength (narrative and character)
- Language precision and specificity
- Character uniqueness (quirks, contradictions)
- Story beat originality

### Anti-Generic Filters
Detects and flags:
- Clichéd language
- Stock characters
- Predictable beats
- Generic themes and messages

## Quality Thresholds

### Distinctiveness Requirement
Stories must meet minimum thresholds:
- No generic language (cliché detection score)
- No stock characters (character uniqueness score)
- No predictable beats (beat originality score)

### Voice Consistency
Character and narrative voices must:
- Remain distinctive throughout all stages
- Maintain consistent patterns (with intentional shifts documented)
- Show clear differentiation between characters

### Memorability Metrics
Language and character choices must:
- Meet minimum distinctiveness scores
- Show improvement from draft to revision
- Prioritize impact per word within word count constraints

## Constraints

### Word Count
- Maximum: ≤ 7500 words
- Philosophy: Maximize impact per word, not just stay under limit

### Conflict-First
Scaffolding prioritizes conflict identification and structure as foundation for narrative.

### Modularity
Each stage can run independently or as part of full pipeline, maintaining clear separation of concerns.
